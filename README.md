### *"Gwei Check" is a gas fee estimator for the Ethereum Blockchain that populates new estimates every 10 seconds.*

"Gwei Check" de-mystifies these estimates with the help of a background color that adjusts along a gradient of blue (low gas fees) to red (high gas fees), as well as a card that indicates if fees are Low, Average, or High. The app can also be configured to send an email alert when gas fees are Low.  A progress bar located at the bottom of the app indicates when gas fee estimates will be refreshed. Fun fact, a "gwei" represents one billionth of an Ether!

### Key Features:
- Home page dynamically updates with data from Blocknative's API: https://docs.blocknative.com/gas-platform

- Loading bar indicates when gas fee estimation will refresh
